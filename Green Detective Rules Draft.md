**Number of Players**: 5

**Overall Description**:  
Green Detective is a social-deduction game. 5 players will be divided into two teams with different objectives–Green Detectives and Corporate Interests. Each round of Green Detective will feature a mission taking place within a protected area located in Southern California. The current mission leader can propose a party of a set number of players to go on the mission, and attempt to fix an issue the area is facing. All players can vote to accept or deny the party of players. If the vote fails, the next player in line will have an opportunity to create another party. Voting is based on majority (3 or more).

Once the mission team is selected, each player on the team will privately vote for the mission to fail or succeed. If all players vote for the mission to succeed, the issue will be resolved. If even one player votes to fail, the entire mission will be failed. The results of these missions will visually impact the mission location. 

There will be up to 5 missions per game. If 3 missions fail, the Corporate Interests side will win. If 3 missions succeed, the Chevron representative will get a chance to replace the head of the National Parks Conservation Association with a corrupt official. If the Chevron representative correctly chooses the NPCA head, the Corporate Interests will win the game. If they choose incorrectly, the Green Detectives will win.

**Setup**:  
Players will be split into two teams, Green Detectives and Corporate Interests, and will be randomly assigned roles within the team.

**Roles**:

* National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) Representative  
  * A Green Detective. Knows who the Chevron Representative is.  
* American Hiking Society (AKS) Representative  
  * A Green Detective. Knows which people are the ExxonMobil Representative and the NPCA Representative but can’t discern between the two.  
* Traveler  
  * A Green Detective. No extra information.  
* ExxonMobil Representative  
  * A Corporate Interest. No extra information.  
* Chevron Representative  
  * A Corporate Interest. No extra information. If three missions are completed successfully, this player has one chance to correctly identify the NPCA Representative and “replace” them with a corrupt official, winning the game for the Corporate Interests.

**Goals**:

Green Detectives

As part of the Green Detectives, your goals will be to identify and keep Corporate Interests out of the selected parties to successfully pass missions. You also must keep the identity of the NPCA head secret to avoid losing the game to Chevron. Do not fall for the deception of the Corporate Interest players\!

Corporate Interests

As part of the Corporate Interests, your goals will be to spread misinformation and cause infighting within the Green Detectives, allowing your team to go on missions and fail them. You want to avoid being identified as an obvious Corporate Interest, while trying to discover who the NPCA head is to be able to target them. Try to identify your fellow Corporate Interest to avoid going against their goals.
